        <h3>What was I doing before?</h3>
        <p>After graduating from Biola University with a BA in Film, I had many adventures in Hollywood.  I got to do some great work such as writing episodes of "Krypto the Superdog" for Cartoon Network and "Brandy and Mr. Whiskers" for Disney Channel.  I also worked in production management for Disney Animation Studios, wrote a graphic novel ("Scrooge and Santa"), and wrote and directed three independent films ("The Umpire", "Speak to Me in Poetry", and "The Virgins").</p>

        <h4>Why would I want to stop?</h4>
        <p>Oh, I don't want to!  I certainly want to keep writing.  But the problem is that none of it has made me much money.  Not enough to live on, anyway, so I have always had to have other jobs.  And I also decided I want to live back in Seattle near my family.</p>

        <h5>So why code?</h5>
        <p>Coding is a lot like screenwriting!  For both of them the goal is to create a script that will effectively communicate.  In screenwriting the goal is to communicate to the actors and production team so they can create something that will eventually communicate to the audience.  In coding the goal is to communicate to the browser so it can communicate to the user.</p>
