        <h3>What was I doing before?</h3>
        <p>After graduating from Biola University with a degree in Film, I had many adventures in Hollywood!  I got to do some great work such as writing episodes of "Krypto the Superdog" for Cartoon Network and "Brandy and Mr. Whiskers" for Disney Channel.  I also worked in production management for Disney Animation Studios, wrote a graphic novel ("Scrooge and Santa"), and wrote and directed three independent films ("The Umpire", "Speak to Me in Poetry", and "The Virgins").</p>
